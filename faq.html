                        It's a mobile app that will scan your phone's call log and identify all business numbers you don't have in your contacts. You can use it to see places and businesses you occasionally interact with but not often enough to remember to save them in contacts, to find out time or frequency of your calls to a particular place, or just if you are curious and want to see what your call log has become over the years.
                        It can also help you better organize identified places and provide some useful features like showing place on map or adding it to contacts with the gathered data already set up.

                        Bizzloggr can be useful to anyone who makes calls with their phone. It is perfect if you don't have the habit to add random places you contact occasionally to your phonebook. It can help you find a certain place you contacted a while ago, or to remember when was the last time you called it. Once you have the places identified, you can use and arrange them the way you want. For business people, it can provide valuable information about your business clients and your interaction history with them.

                        Bizzloggr is able to identify business numbers that are registered on map services like <i>Google maps</i> or <i>Bing maps</i>. It is not intended to be used for personal numbers unless they are associated with a place on a map. Places data is usually provided by general public users or business owners and it's accuracy may vary.

We will keep improving the app by adding more useful stuff in the future updates for the full version, while Bizzloggr Lite will receive only the most crucial ones.

                        Good question. First of all, the data provided by the app is not free to get. Service providers we use will charge to identify each number in you call log and the app price is estimated based on that costs. Regardless, making such a nice app takes time and effort and it always good to support the developers for providing awesome solutions and experiences.

                        In order to identify the numbers Bizzloggr has to access your phone's call log so this permission is a part of the core functionality of the app. We are committed to keep minimal permission requirements and take care of your private data so, other than using phone numbers from your log to get the place information, the app is not using call history data in any other way. Other than that, the app needs the permission to access the internet so it can fetch place data for each call. So, as you can see, Bizzloggr only ask you to allow it to do it's job: List your calls and try to identify them. Nothing more.

                        First of all, make sure you have a working and stable internet connection. If that's the case, try uninstalling the app and installing it again (don't worry, you won't be charged again if you already purchased the app). In some cases, Bizzloggr will not be able to identify the numbers made by your previous SIM card(s) especially if they were not from your current operator or country. In the end, maybe you just don't have any identifiable numbers in your call log.

                        Bizzloggr is always processing calls from your phone's call log, so if you have deleted a call in your default dialing app, the associated place will also disappear from Bizzloggr place list if there are not other calls to it.
